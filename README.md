Project Description:
The project focuses on expanding on an AI agent to play the word association game Apples to Apples. Current approach includes using pre-trained language models to find the best association or most humorous connection between words to find a card for the agent to play. Expansion on the project will include creating and training additional judge models using the current program as a baseline, as well as expanding and improving on the training sets for models already implemented. Additionally, alternative methods for detecting judge behaviour of other agents/players will be explored.
